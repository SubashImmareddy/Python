This is my personal space for practicing Python. I’m solving problems from YouTube tutorials, coding challenge sites, and random exercises I come across. It’s mainly for learning, experimenting, and tracking my progress over time.

The repo is simple: problems has my solutions, notes has quick explanations or lessons learned, and later I might add topics to group problems by category.

I’m keeping this repo to stay consistent with practice, improve problem-solving skills, and explore different approaches to coding challenges.
